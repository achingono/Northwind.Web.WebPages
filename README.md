Alfero's Northwind Project
================================

This project is a demonstration of several technologies

* Entity Framework Code-First
* ASP.NET WebPages
* ASP.NET Web API
* Knockout
* T4 Templates
* Twitter Bootstrap
* JQuery

Entity Framework
----------------

Here I wanted to find out if I can use Entity Framework Code First without modifying the database.

ASP.NET Web Pages
-----------------

While discussing with a co-worker I came up with an idea 
to put together a project that demonstrates the feasibility of building a functional application with just
ASP.NET Web Pages and ASP.NET Web API controllers. 

Knockout
--------

I simply fell in love with the concept, but wasn't sure if I could build a scalable real-world application with it.


T4 Templates
--------------

Here, I use T4 templates powered by T4 Toolbox to generate project files. 
I use reflection to discover class properties and attributes which are in turn used to generate other classes/files.


Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------

I now prefer this framework over jQuery UI. Just me.

jQuery
------

I don't think I have to explain this one.

Getting Started
===============

Just open the project in Visual Studio and run.

Disclaimer
==========

This project is just a proof-of-concept. I do not claim to be an expert at any of the technologies demonstrated here.
I only share in the hope that someone finds it useful.
